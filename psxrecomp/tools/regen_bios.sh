# regen_bios.sh — canonical, hygiene-safe regeneration of the BIOS generated C.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: generated/<stem>_*.c is gitignored build output. The
# recompiler (psxrecomp-bios) and the runtime are built by SEPARATE CMake trees,
# so editing the BIOS emitter (full_function_emitter.cpp, strict_translator.cpp,
# the cycle headers, …) does NOT automatically refresh generated/. If you forget
# to regenerate, the runtime links a STALE BIOS that no longer matches the emitter
# (this bit us: a stale 4439-entry BIOS vs the current 4406-entry output). This
# script makes regeneration one command AND records an emitter fingerprint so the
# CMake build can warn when generated/ has drifted (see runtime/runtime.cmake).
#
# PREREQUISITE: a CONFIGURED recompiler build dir. This script builds the
# emitter, it does not configure it — on a fresh clone run this first:
#   cmake -S recompiler -B recompiler/build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#
# Usage:
#   tools/regen_bios.sh                               # regen from bios/SCPH1001.toml
#   tools/regen_bios.sh --config bios/OpenBIOS.toml   # regen another BIOS profile
#   PSXRECOMP_BIOS_BUILD=recompiler/build tools/regen_bios.sh   # custom build dir
#
# PSXRECOMP_BIOS_BUILD is relative to the framework ROOT (this script cd's there
# before using it), NOT to your shell's cwd. From a game project that vendors the
# framework, that is `recompiler/build` — never `psxrecomp/recompiler/build`.
#
# Legacy env-override form (bypasses the profile; used for scratch regens into a
# different out dir — fingerprint stem falls back to PSXRECOMP_BIOS_STEM/SCPH1001):
#   PSXRECOMP_BIOS_ROM=... PSXRECOMP_BIOS_SEEDS=... PSXRECOMP_BIOS_OUT=... tools/regen_bios.sh
#
# Run from the framework root (the dir containing recompiler/ and generated/).
