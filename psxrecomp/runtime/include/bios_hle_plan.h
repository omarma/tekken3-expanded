/* bios_hle_plan.h — the ONE place the BIOS-backend axes are decided.
 *
 * The HLE tier has two INDEPENDENT axes, and conflating them was a real bug:
 *
 *   call_hle  — service implemented kernel calls (B0 events) in HLE instead of
 *               the recompiled BIOS. Needs the per-image `deliver_event_ret`
 *               anchor, because a delivered callback has to return through the
 *               exact $ra the kernel's DeliverEvent loop uses. An image that
 *               does not export it CANNOT run call-HLE at all.
 *
 *   boot_skip — the one-shot shell intercept that skips the BIOS boot animation
 *               and lets Main() proceed straight to SYSTEM.CNF + game EXE load.
 *               Needs only the per-image `shell_entry_phys` anchor, and works
 *               under pure LLE: nothing is synthesized, the shell call simply
 *               returns immediately, exactly as if the player had let the disc
 *               menu exit on its own.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS MODULE FIXES (2026-07-27). main.cpp used to force the requested
 * `bios_hle` flag to false when an image exported no `deliver_event_ret` (the
 * correct call-HLE decision), and THEN derived boot_skip from that already-
 * mutated flag. So on OpenBIOS — which deliberately omits deliver_event_ret
 * until its B0 semantics are validated, but does export shell_entry_phys — the
 * player's boot-skip silently stopped working: choosing OpenBIOS sat the player
 * in the boot animation while the same build on retail SCPH-1001 went straight
 * to the game. One flag, two behaviours, depending on a BIOS detail no player
 * can see.
 *
 * The rule is now explicit and image-independent: `bios_hle` (or the deprecated
 * `fast_boot` alias) means "skip the BIOS boot and go to the game", on EVERY
 * BIOS that exports a shell entry. Whether the same flag additionally routes
 * kernel calls through HLE is a separate, anchor-gated question.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (no CPUState, no psx_bios_image, no runtime globals) so
 * the whole decision matrix is unit-tested directly — see
 * runtime/tests/test_bios_hle_plan.c.
